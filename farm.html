      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Farm Overview</h1>

      <p>Upon completing the Character Creation, you're transported to your Farm. Inherited from your grandfather after quitting your job at Joja Corporation, it is your duty to restore the land and make use of it.</p>

      <p>The main way to make money, and what you will most likely spend the most time on, is the farm that your grandfather has handed down to you.
        Located in Stardew Valley, your farm is completely customizable from starting maps, names, what crops you choose to raise, and even how you choose
        to decorate the land.</p>

      <p></p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Farm Map</h1>
      <p>There are five starting maps to choose from when you first begin a game file. The maps all have different high and low points,
      so there needs to be careful consideration to what kind of play style that you want to have for your farm.</p>

      <p>The Player's farm house will appear the same on all maps from the exterior, but the interior is uniquely styled after the chosen map's theme.</p>

      <p>Each map will change how the farm appears on the game's overworld map slightly. Most simply change how the farm area appeares, but some maps will change areas outside the farm.
      The Forest farm extends the forest to the west toward the farm and the Riverland map connects to a river which flows south of the Desert.
      These changes are only shown on the overworld map. No changes are made to the actual Valley outside of the Player's farm.</p>

      <p>After selecting a map, it cannot be changed. Each map takes up the same area, but there are different amounts of usable, farmable, and buildable land on each.</a>

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Farmhouse</h1>
      <p>The Farmhouse is the Player's house. This is where the Player will end each day by sleeping in the bed within. The Farmhouse is customizable with furniture, flooring, and walpapers. The Farmhouse
      can be upgraded 3 times, once by paying 10,000 gold and 450 Wood, and again by paying 50,000 gold and 150 hardwood. The final upgrade adds a cellar, which can age wine and cheese. This final upgrade
      costs 100,000 gold. All Farmhouse upgrades take 2 full days to complete.</p>

      <p>Upon completion of the marriage ceremony, the person that the Player marries will have a portion of their own room moved into the right side of your Farmhouse. This requires a tier 2 Farmhouse.</p>

      <h4 class="w3-text-black w3-border-bottom">Mailbox</h4>

      <p>The Mailbox to the right of your Farmhouse is where you will recieve mail from the residents of Stardew Valley. These can include gifts or recipes, or also contain quests and town messages.</p>

      <h4 class="w3-text-black w3-border-bottom">Shipping Box</h4>

      <p>The Shipping Box is located to the right of the Farmhouse. Items with a coin value can be placed inside the box and will be sold overnight with the earnings from selling the items displayed in a table
      once the Player goes to bed for the night.</p>

      <p>The latest item placed in the Shipping Box can be recovered, but the items placed before the latest item are lost. For example, if the Player puts in a Jam and then a Corn,
      the Player can remove the Corn but not the Jam.</p>

      <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
        <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Crops</h1>

        There are many different crops within Stardew Valley for the player to grow and sell.

        <h4 class="w3-text-black w3-border-bottom">Crops</h4>

        <p>Seends for crops can be bought from the General Store, with the selection correlating to the current season, or obtained from completing bundles from the Community Center. Seeds can only be planted on the farm or
        in the Greenhouse. In order to begin growing a crop, the Player must till a square of dirt with a Hoe. Once tilled, the seed can be placed in the ground, and must be watered once a day with a Watering Can. Once the seed
        is fully gornw, it may be harvested. Most crops only grow once, and the entire plant is harvested, but for crops like berries and corn, these crops will have their edible portions harvested, allowing the crop to grow again.</p>

        <p>Once the season for a crop has ended, the plant will wither and die overnight and will be dead on the first day of the new season.</p>

        <h4 class="w3-text-black w3-border-bottom">Fruit Trees</h4>

        <p>Fruit Tree seeds can also be bought from the General Store and sowed on the farm in the center of a 3x3 square of land. All fruit trees take 28 days to mature completely, and, depending on the season, will produce 1 fruit per day.
        Fruit trees do not produce fruit during the winter season.</p>

        <h4 class="w3-text-black w3-border-bottom">Crop Risks</h4>

        <p>Crops have additional risks to dying, such as crows eating the crops overnight, and wilting if the Player fails to water them. The only way crows can be countered is by placing Scarecrows. Scarecrows can be created by crafting.</p>

Each of the upgrades allows for the support of more animals.</p>

        <p>The Player can also build Silos, which allow for the collection of Hay, which is needed to feed animals.</p>

              <p>Once your total earnings reaches 25,000 gold, Demetrius meets you at your door the next day. He states that he is working on research and asks if you wouldn't mind if he used your cave.
              He gives the Player the option to either have fruit bats in their cave, or install plots for growing various types of mushrooms.</p>

              <p>Picking fruit bats will cause a random druit (from 4 fruits) to be placed in the cave, while picking the mushrooms will cause Demetrius to build 6 plots for growing mushrooms, and will cause 5 different types of mushrooms to grow in the cave.</p>

                <p>The Greenhouse in the beginning is unusable, as the Player seems to assume it was destroyed by a storm. Completing the Pantry section of the Community Center will cause the Greenhouse to be restored, and be of use to the Player. Inside is a 12x10 plot of land for
                growing crops, and a water trough to refill your Watering Can. Any seeds from any season may be planted here, even during winter. Buildings may not be placed inside of the Greenhouse.</p>
